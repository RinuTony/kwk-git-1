    <div class="bio">
        <p> I'm a final year Computer Science Student from God's Own Country, Kerala in India.
            I enjoy learning new things and turning ideas into code.
            I love thoughtful conversations, getting lost in a good book, and curating oddly specific playlists.
            I'm just figuring things out as I go, and honestly, kind of impressed with how far I’ve come.

        <h2>✮ ⋆ ˚｡𖦹 ⋆｡°✩ my coding journey</h2>
        <p>
            My coding journey kicked off in 2021 with the KWK Web Development camp, 
            where I built my first website and realized tech could be both fun and powerful. 
            That spark led me to take Computer Science classes in high school, and before I knew it, 
            I was diving headfirst into a full-on CS degree. Since then, I’ve been exploring the world of code 
            one project at a time learning new things, messing up a lot, and slowly figuring out what 
            kind of tech I actually enjoy building.
